            Please choose 3 websites you visit frequently and state 
            what you like and dislike about each of the 3. 

            Try to use some of the new terms & ideas you have learned
            this week in class.

            Additionally, for each site answer the following questions:

            1a. What do you feel is the primary color used on
                the website? 
            1b. Do you feel the mood/feeling of the color 
                matches the purpose of the site?

            2a. Who do you believe are the primary users 
                of the site? 
            2b. Does the website's chosen design cater 
                to that user base, if so how?

            3a. What are the users' tasks and goals by 
                visiting the site?
            3b. Is this task/goal easy to accomplish or find 
                and does the site showcase this information?

            4.  Do you feel the site succeeds in providing 
                a good user experience (UX)?
