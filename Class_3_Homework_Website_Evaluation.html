        <p>The assignment was for me to choose three websites which I visit frequently and to then discuss my likes and dislikes about each.
        </p>
        
        <p>The three websites I will reviewing are <a href='#Twitter' >Twitter</a>, <a href='#Reverbnation'  >Reverbnation</a> and <a href='Gmail'  >Gmail</a>. I have spent an ennormus amount of time of both <a href="//twitter.com" >Twitter</a> & <a href="//reverbnation.com./shawofomaha">Reverbnation</a>. As social media  expert for my band, Smokhaus, I both built a website for the band (which is now down) and started all the social media accounts for our band. Facebook, Google+, Instagram, Reverbnation & Twitter!
        </p>
        
        <p>I'll be answering the same questions about each of the websites:</p>
        
        <p>What you like and dislike about each website? What is the primary color of this website? How do I feel the mood/feeling of the color matches the purpose of the site?
        </p>
        
        <p>Who do I believe are the primary users of the site, and does the website's chosen design cater to that user base, if so how?
        </p>
        
        <p>What are the users tasks and goals by visiting the site? Is this task/goal easy to accomplish or find, and does the site showcase this information
        </p>
        
        <p>Finally, what is my overall assessment of the UX experience on each site?
        </p>

        <div id='Twitter'> <br /> <br />
          <h2 padding-top: 5px; >Twitter</h2>

              </div>
              
              <p>I love the clean look of and fast load times of Twitter.  One nice thing that is not immediately noticeable, is the fact the site scales to many different form factors, naturally! Both when either re-sizing a browser window or with the use of a handheld device, the site seems to flow naturally.
              </p>
              
              <p>Since the design is so clean, it is hard to find things to dislike.
              </p>
              
              <p>The color scheme is White with an accent of blue. All other colors seem to come from the content posted.
              </p>
              
              <p>The color scheme does seem to match the sites purpose, which is to get out of the way of user content.
              </p>
              
              <p>The primary users of the site are, obviously Twitter account holders, which now number around <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/282087/number-of-monthly-active-twitter-users/" target="_blank"><b>317 million</b></a>. Since the last election cycle, Twitter has taken on even more importance as a mouthpiece for President Trump. SNL has taken to impressions that do not meet with Trump's <a href="http://popcrush.com/saturday-night-donald-trump-twitter-response-cold-open/" target="_blank">approval</a>.
              </p>
              
              <p>The website design of clean and simple <b>does</b> seem to cater to the user base. The user base are the ones determining how the site looks thru their tweets and media attachments. Recently both videos and giphy's have been introduced into the Twitter universe.</p>  
              
              <p>There are <a href="http://www.momthisishowtwitterworks.com/" target="_blank" >many goals</a> users have in visiting the Twitter. These sharing thoughts and feelings.

              <p>Twitter gets out of the way of it's users to allow them to use the site showcase the information they want to share.</p>  
              
              <p>When  ansering the question <em>"Does the site succeed in providing a good user experience?",</em> I would suggest that Twitter does an outstanding job by not cluttering the interface.This then allows the user to define their experience for themselves.
              </p>
              
              <p>This goal is <b>NOT</b> easy to accomplish, but Twitter and it's 317 million users are accomplishing this task every second.</p>

              </div>
              
              <p style="padding-right: 5%;">Reverbnation has each landing page built by a Web driven Band website builder. For this <br>reason, it impossible to judge. However, since templates are used the site as a whole is <br>strengthed as common elements are placed similarly in each artist or bands profile.
              </p>
              
              <p>It is easy to dislike the fact that every Band or Artist page is contructed similarly. However, <br>for a person cruising to find new band the similarity as an actual strength.
              </p>
              
              <p>The color scheme is White with an accents of Black, blue and red. The Black is used in the Navigaton Header and footer, with the Link words <b>highlighting</b> to white text on hover. Other minolr accent colors used are a light brown and a darker blue.
              </p>
              
              <p>The color scheme does seem to match the sites main purpose, which is to get out of the way <br>of user content. Red was used as an accent color to draw attention to Reverbnation clickable <br>Logo in the upper left of the page.
              </p>
              
              <p>The primary users of the site are band members (promoting their music to other bands and <br>artists) and the public at large who may looking to find new music. Promoters, internet radio stations and other content providers also frequent the site.
